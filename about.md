title: About this project
---

<p align="justify">In this project I have created Google Colab notebooks for each deep learning method with descriptions and code examples. These notebooks will explain these methods in a simple way with hands-on examples. The target audience are new learners interested in learning deep learning methods in a simple and organized manner and in a shorter time. The codes are all hosted on Google Colab servers, so, no local GPU required ;) I have covered from simple models such as MLP, to more complex models such Transformers that is the state of the art architecture used for language processing. In addition, two extra notebooks have been created for BERT, and GPT-2 which are two of the leadning language models based on transformers. These notebooks teach how to fine-tune these models</p>

<p align="justify">This project is part of the 2022 BOLD fellowship program at Georgia Institute of Technology. The goal of the project is to create an open educational resource that can be used in a blended or an online course. The objective of the project is to help students learn the course topics better. Therefore, this interactive deep learning lab was created to help the students become familiar with deep learning models that they can implement for their projects with access to reference codes. The goal of these notebooks is not to go into very fine detail and math behind the models but to focus on the application of these models in a higher level.</p>
