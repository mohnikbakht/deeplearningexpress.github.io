title: About this project
---

In this project I have created Google Colab notebooks for each deep learning method with descriptions and code examples. These notebooks will explain these methods in a simple way with hands-on experience. The target audience will be new learners interested in learning deep learning methods in a simple and organized mannerand in a limited time. The codes are all hosted on Google Colab servers, thus, no local GPU required! I have covered models from MLP, to Transformers which are the state of the art architecture. In addition, two extra notebooks have been created for BERT, and GPT-2 which are two of the leadning language models based on transformers.

This project is part of the BOLD fellowship program. The goal of the project is to create an open educational resource that can be used in a blended or an online course. The objective of the project is to help students learn the course topics better. Therefore, this interactive deep learning lab was created to help the students become familiar with deep learning models that they can implement for their projects with access to reference codes. The notebooks don't go into very fine detail and math behind the models but focus on the application of these models in a higher level.
