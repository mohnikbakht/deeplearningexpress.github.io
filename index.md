  ## Deep Learning Express
  A quick head start for deep learning from MLP to Transformers, BERT, and GPT-2
---

Through these 6 Google Colab notebooks you will learn necessary deep learning concepts and you will learn how to code deep learning models using PyTorch

1. Notebook 1 (Key Concepts): In this notebook you will learn the required deep learning (and ML) concepts before diving into the model architectures.
