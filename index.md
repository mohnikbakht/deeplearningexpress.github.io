  ## Deep Learning Express
  A quick head start for deep learning from MLP to Transformers, BERT, and GPT-2
---

<p><em>Through these 6 Google Colab notebooks you will learn necessary deep learning concepts and you will learn how to code deep learning models using PyTorch</em></p>

<hr>

<p><b>Notebook 1 (Key Concepts):</b> In this notebook you will learn the required deep learning (and ML) concepts before diving into the model architectures.</p>
<p style="color:blue;"> If you want to do data visualization, data compression, encryption, or simple classification, MLP might be a good choice! </p>
